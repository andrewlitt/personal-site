We went west!

## Itinerary

Kicking off the trip on Canada Day weekend, The Guys (members of the trip, herein described as "The Guys") set out to see 140km of the icy blue Kootenay River. 

1. **<a href='#1'>Calgary to McLeod Meadows (30th)</a>**
2. **<a href='#2'>McLeod Meadows and Back Again (1st, 38km)</a>**
3. **<a href='#3'>McLeod Meadows to Horseshoe Rapids (2nd, 24km)</a>**
4. **<a href='#4'>Horshoe Rapids to shy of Pallister River Confluence (3rd)</a>**
5. **<a href='#5'>Shy of Pallister to White River Confluence (4th)</a>**
6. **<a href='#6'>White River Confluence to The Last Set </a>**
7. **<a href='#7'>The Last Set to Canal Flats (6th, 30km)</a>**

Upon our return, Calgary was on the eve of Stampede. We had fun there as well.

## The River

For our <a href="https://alitt.ca/blog/coulonge/" target="_blank">last trip</a>, The Guys knew it well - while it was our first time doing our own logistics, many had run the Coulonge River in a past life. This time, less so. Most of us have never been to the BC interior outside of shredding gnar. We had to read up.

- **<a href="http://parkscanadahistory.com/publications/kootenay/vermilion-kootenay-paddler-guide.pdf" target="_blank">A Paddler's Guide to the Vermilion-Kootenay River</a>** is an undated publication from Parks Canada and British Columbia Ministry of Forests. This gem details every bend, every set, and all the sights to see along the way. This was our holy bible, and this write-up is mostly plagarism off of it.
- **<a href="https://paddlingmaps.com/trip/British%20Columbia/154-mcleod-meadows-to-canal-flats" target="_blank">PaddlingMaps: McLeod Meadows to Canal Flats</a>** is a great assist for suggesting campsites, noting features, and generally helped plan how we broke this trip into chunks.

## Gearing Up

To stay afloat, <a href="https://www.rockymountainpaddling.com/" target="_blank">Rocky Mountain Paddling Centre</a> in Calgary's west end was our saviour. We rented 5 boats and a trailer, including other gear essentails: paddles, PFD's, throwbags, bailers, and whistles. Mostly 17' Nova Craft Prospectors, these bad boys were fully loaded with airbags to keep us afloat on rogue ducky style sets.

For remaining gear we rented from <a href="https://outdoor-centre.ucalgary.ca/gear-rentals" target="_blank">UofC's Outdoor Centre</a>: barrels, packs, tarps, tents, and whatever campsite gear The Guys did't own themselves. 

## The Trip

 #### <p id="1">1. Calgary to McLeod Meadows (30th)</p>

By end of day on the 30th, all The Guys and their stuff assembled in Calgary. After work, we drove to a campsite booked at McLeod Meadows in Kootenay National Park.

Had something gone wrong with gathering gear, we also could've headed out the morning of the 1st. It was flexible.

#### <p id="2">2. McLeod Meadows and Back Again (1st, 38km)</p>

To truly start the trip, the team at <a href="https://www.rentfarout.com/" target="_blank">Far Out Gear Rentals</a> in Radium Hot Sprints were invaluable. This morning we left our campsite intact at McLeod Meadows and headed down the road to Far Out. They suggested where to leave our cars, hooked up to our trailer, and shuttled us up to the drop at Vermilion Crossing. This driving involved some doubling back, but luckily didn't burn much time!

Vermillion Crossing itself is a bridge over the Kootenay on Highway 93. The west side of the highway is a day-use area in Kootenay National Park. On the east side is Kootenay Park Lodge, which we also entertained as a place to park for the week (they didn't pick up the phone).

From here, the trip began! Day one is 38km of moving water, mountain goats, gorges, and one big set. Light work.

This first day on the river ended back at... McLeod Meadows. There's no primitive camping allowed along the river while in Kootenay Park, so we had to stop where we started the day. Bonus was having to set up camp, and empty boats for the day!

#### <p id="3">3. McLeod Meadows to Horseshoe Rapids (2nd, 22km)</p>

On this day, we get out of the park.

## The Return

From our end at Canal Flats, we booked a shuttle from <a href="https://www.rentfarout.com/" target="_blank">Far Out Gear Rentals</a> to take us back to our cars at Vermilion Crossing. Should take roughly an hour a half. From there, we'll hop in and spend another two hours driving back to Cowtown. Then it's Stampede.
