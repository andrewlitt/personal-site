Well - this is it, it exitst.
 
I've been thinking about it for awhile now, actually. But the way I wanted it was always what held it up - no Wordpress, I wanted to build the site myself. Make a project out of it.

The real shout out goes to my wisdom teeth. Without the incredibly boring week that followed their departure, I would've found anything more fun than the coding to do. Thanks boys, I won't miss you.

So yeah, thing's made. Welcome to my internet corner, read around as it (hopefully) grows. Cheers.
