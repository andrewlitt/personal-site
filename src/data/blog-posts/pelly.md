We took a trip to the mighty Yukon. It was a rip.

An idea to paddle in the Great White North came abouts last year, when I hiked the Chilkoot trail with our local correspondant DH. I've greatly enjoyed my visits to the Yukon - with DH available to join us for the expedition, the brainstorming began. While there are many excellent waters in the Yukon, we opted to save on floatplanes this year. These things considered, one river fell in our sights: the Pelly.

The Pelly begins in the Mackenzie Mountains and flows 530km before joining with the mighty Yukon River. It flows about 4-10 km/hr (5km/hr average) in a westerly way, past ruins of trappers cabins and hoodoos galore.


## The Plan

Starting on a Friday, the members of this trip, herein described as The Guys, will begin their trips with a flight to Whitehorse. From there, we'll grab a shuttle to see 290km of the Pelly You can follow along at the link below:

As said earlier, we have two goals: to get some whitewater, and to reach Dawson City.

So, we have two viable drop spots on the Pelly River: Faro or Pelly Crossing. There is _nothing_ in between these places.

Pelly Crossing is close to the end of the Pelly, about 60km back from its confluence with the Yukon River. Dropping here would give us minimal whitewater, and combined with the speed of the Yukon River, it would be a river cruise of a trip.
